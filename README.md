# onoff

A parser for off documents.

# DISCLAIMER

THIS PROJECT IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.

While it works as far i tested it, it is/was just a side project exploring parsing
and the off format.

If you need a off document parser i would recommend the following one
[`michidk/off-rs`](https://github.com/michidk/off-rs).
